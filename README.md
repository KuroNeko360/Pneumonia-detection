**Pneumonia Detection**

Pneumonia is a severe respiratory disease caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses, leading to fluid or pus accumulation in the lungs' air sacs. Chest X-rays are the primary diagnostic tool, but their interpretation requires medical expertise, which can delay diagnosis and treatmentâ€”especially in remote areas with limited healthcare access.

This project leverages machine learning and computer vision to develop an automated pneumonia detection system using chest X-ray images. By integrating AI-driven diagnosis, the system aims to assist healthcare professionals and improve early detection, potentially saving lives
